## `cnqr`: An R Package

This repository holds R code for the implementation of the __composite nonlinear quantile regression__ (CNQR) methodology proposed in [Vincenzo Coia's thesis](https://open.library.ubc.ca/cIRcle/collections/ubctheses/24/items/1.0342941), bundled as an R package. It currently depends on the R packages [`copsupp`](https://bitbucket.org/vcoia/copsupp) and [`CopulaModel`](http://copula.stat.ubc.ca/).

Sorry for the one-commit-wonder, and for the inaccessibility of this package. You can expect quick-fixes to the latter soon, and probably some larger updates as I modify the `copsupp` package, along with a vignette.
